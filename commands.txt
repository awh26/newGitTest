http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601931/best-and-safest-way-to-merge-a-git-branch-into-master
update master from branch
git checkout <branchname>
git status

<<THIS IS JUST A NOTE>>
<<do this only if there are files you need to add after doing "git status">>
git add (add whatever files your want to merge with your master)
git commit -m "place commit message here")
git push

git merge <branchname>
git push origin master


DELETING A BRANCH

git push origin --delete <branchname>
